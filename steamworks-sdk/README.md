## Where are the files?

Even if copies of the SDK can be found all over GitHub, it's technically not allowed to "redistribute" any source files according to Valve's license agreement.

## How to "install"

Just drop the content of the `sdk/` folder here. Only the `public/steam/` and `redistributable_bin/` subfolders are required.
